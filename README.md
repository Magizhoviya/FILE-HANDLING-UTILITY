# TASK DESCRIPTION
Objective:

The primary objective of this task is to understand and implement file handling operations in Java. File handling is a fundamental aspect of software development that involves creating, reading, writing, updating, and deleting files. By completing this task, students will gain hands-on experience in working with files, which is essential for data storage, retrieval, and processing in real-world applications.

Task Overview:

In this task, you are required to design and implement a Java program that demonstrates various file handling operations. Your program should be capable of performing the following functionalities:

Creating a File:
The program should allow users to create a new file with a specified name. If the file already exists, the program should notify the user appropriately.

Writing to a File:
The program must support writing user input (such as text or data) into the created file. Each new entry should be appended to avoid overwriting previous content.

Reading from a File:
Your program should be able to read the contents of the file and display them to the user line by line.

Updating the File:
Implement a function to update specific content in the file. For example, replacing a word or a line with new content. You may use a temporary file approach for this.

Deleting a File:
The program should allow the user to delete a file by specifying the filename, with appropriate confirmation and error handling.

Expected Output:

The program should be menu-driven, where the user can choose which operation to perform. It should handle exceptions (like FileNotFoundException, IOException, etc.) gracefully and provide meaningful messages to the user.

Learning Outcomes:

Upon completing this task, learners will:

Understand the use of File, FileWriter, FileReader, BufferedReader, and Scanner classes in Java.

Learn how to manage file streams and handle I/O exceptions.

Gain practical experience in performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on files.

Strengthen their problem-solving and logical thinking by applying file operations in a user-interactive application.

Tools Required:

Java Development Kit (JDK)

Any IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code) or a simple text editor

Command line or terminal for compilation and execution

This task will lay a strong foundation for advanced topics such as serialization, file encryption, data persistence, and working with file systems in real-time applications.
